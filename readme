Endless Odyssey
An endless side scrolling shooter in which you find yourself piloting a trireme, 
either avoiding or shooting the ghostly vessels sailing towards you.

WASD or Arrowkeys to control, Space to shoot

There is animation controlled by player directional input, a 3 life 
system and scoreboard on a basic UI overlay, as well as an infinitely scrolling
seamless background

All assests were created by myself using the online photo editor Photopea
